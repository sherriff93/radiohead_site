Welcome to my Radiohead website project!

This is not intended to be for any kind of commercial use. I have used it to demonstrate some Sass, Javascript, Jquery and AngularJS techniques.

Javascript behaviour:

1. When you click an item in the nav, the page will scroll smoothly to that item.
2. The background image has a parallax scrolling effect. The size of the background image is calculated so that the end of the document coincides with the end of the image.
3. The nav bar sticks to the window as the user scrolls past, so to scroll with it.
4. When the nav bar is stuck to the window, it will hide if the user scrolls down, and show if they scroll up.
5. The nav bar will hide if the page is idle for a set amount of time. If the user is hovering on any particular nav item it will not hide.
6. The page sections are made to fade in as the user scrolls.

The tour items, and the albums under "music" are both made under AngularJS directives "tour-item" and "album" respectively.

Note:
The scrolling jerks in Firefox. Currently editting the javascript behaviour to decrease the amount of calculation needed when scrolling.
